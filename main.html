      Here is how this domain got fucked.
    </h1>
    <p>
      So here is the story: I have this friend named Advaith. I had some money and decided to work with them on some projects by buying domains for them. Well I own this domain, Advaith doesn't. What is Moosic anyways?? Moosic is a Discord bot that does a lot of stuff. Why did I own this domain and what happened here??? Well that is a good question and there are many answers to this I can give to these two things. I am going to do the most simple answer. I bought the domain FOR ADVAITH and did not transfer it which was a bad move where Advaith didn't ask me to do so. After about 3 months of this domain being owned by me, I ran into an issue. I realized I was at a huge disadvantage, and got into financial hell. I tried to sell this domain for $5 to Advaith and Will, neither of which are paying me, which is bad. The next time I get money is in April, and most of that will go to other things. So I need this domain bought soon. I am willing to sell to anyone at this point as I lost ALL hope in Will (Advaith's friend) or Advaith trying to buy it. At this point I am desperate. Contact me at Safyre@safyrelyons.com or pay me on <a href="paypal.me/safyredeveloper">PayPal</a>, I just need this domain GONE!! Price $10 (price negotiable).
