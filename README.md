### An Explanation 

Go to [this link](https://medium.com/@safyrelyons/my-huge-mistake-cc5a3cdc5fa5) for the full version.

In the beginning, it was a much more simple time for me, I didnâ€™t have to worry about my two million domains. But then I realized I needed money to start up my business, ThoughtNADC, which started in a horrible spot, so I needed to rid of the domains. Including, you guessed it, Moosic.co which I thought would be easy, $5, then done. Well I was wrong, apparently I was horribly wrong. So why did I have Adavaith (the owner of the Discord bot Moosic.co belonged to.) pay me for what could be called his domain? Well I do NOTHING for free, I find it idiotic.
